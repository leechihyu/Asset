Here are the summaries for each source to serve as a guide for your discussions.

### 1. Hall & Taylor: "Political Science and the Three New Institutionalisms"
This seminal piece clarifies the landscape of institutionalism by categorizing it into three distinct schools of thought.

*   **Three Schools:** The authors identify **Historical Institutionalism (HI)**, **Rational Choice Institutionalism (RCI)**, and **Sociological Institutionalism (SI)**. 
*   **The Calculus vs. Cultural Approaches:** The piece contrasts the **calculus approach**, which assumes actors are strategic maximizers with exogenous preferences, and the **cultural approach**, where institutions provide moral or cognitive templates that shape the very identities and preferences of actors.
*   **Strengths and Weaknesses:** RCI provides precise micro-foundations but has a "thin" theory of human motivation. SI explains "inefficient" rituals through social legitimacy but can be "bloodless" by ignoring power struggles. HI is eclectic, utilizing both calculus and cultural lenses, but often lacks a precise causal chain explaining how institutions affect behavior.

### 2. Mahoney & Thelen: "A Theory of Gradual Institutional Change"
This source challenges the "punctuated equilibrium" model that sees institutions as stable until an external shock occurs, focusing instead on **endogenous**, incremental change.

*   **The Power-Distributional Approach:** They view institutions as instruments that distribute power unevenly, creating constant tension and "skirmishing" over interpretation.
*   **Four Modes of Change:** They define **Displacement** (removing rules), **Layering** (adding rules), **Drift** (neglecting rules as environment shifts), and **Conversion** (redeploying old rules for new goals).
*   **Contextual Dimensions:** Change is shaped by two factors: **veto possibilities** (strong vs. weak) and **levels of discretion** in enforcement (low vs. high).
*   **Change Agents:** They identify four roles actors play: **Insurrectionaries**, **Subversives** ("termites in the basement"), **Symbionts**, and **Opportunists**.

### 3. North & Weingast: "Constitutions and Commitment"
This article uses 17th-century England and the **Glorious Revolution** to explain how institutional design can facilitate economic growth.

*   **Credible Commitment:** The authors argue that the key problem for the Crown was its inability to "credibly commit" to property rights, which made borrowing expensive and investment risky.
*   **Institutional Solutions:** By establishing **Parliamentary supremacy** and an **independent judiciary**, the Revolution created "veto points" that prevented the King from unilaterally reneging on debts or seizing wealth.
*   **The Fiscal Revolution:** These changes allowed the government to borrow unprecedented sums at much lower interest rates, providing the financial foundation for British hegemony and the Industrial Revolution.

### 4. Pierson: "Increasing Returns, Path Dependence, and the Study of Politics"
This article investigates **path dependence**, conceptualizing it through the economic logic of **increasing returns** or positive feedback.

*   **Increasing Returns:** In these processes, the probability of continuing down a path increases with each step because the costs of exit (switching) rise over time.
*   **Why Politics is Prone to Path Dependence:** Pierson identifies four reasons: the **collective nature** of action, the **density of institutions**, the **use of authority** to magnify power asymmetries, and the **complexity/opacity** of political goals.
*   **Critique of Functionalism:** He warns against assuming institutions exist because they are "efficient"; once a path is locked in, a society may stay on it even if it is suboptimal.

### 5. Tsebelis: "Decision Making in Political Systems: Veto Players"
Tsebelis introduces a unified framework for comparing political systems (presidential vs. parliamentary) based on **Veto Player Theory**.

*   **Veto Player Defined:** An individual or collective actor whose agreement is required to change the status quo. 
*   **Policy Stability:** The capacity for change (policy stability) is determined by the **number** of players, their **congruence** (ideological distance), and their **cohesion**.
*   **The Winset:** The "winset of the status quo" represents all alternatives that can defeat the status quo; a small winset equals high policy stability (or gridlock).

### 6. Brinks, Levitsky, & Murillo: "The Political Origins of Institutional Weakness"
This introduction explores why institutions in regions like Latin America often exist on paper but fail to shape behavior.

*   **Causal Notion of Strength:** They define strength ($S$) as the difference between the **institutional outcome** and what would have happened in the **absence of the institution**.
*   **Three Types of Weakness:**
    *   **Insignificance:** The institution is complied with but has "zero ambition" and changes nothing.
    *   **Noncompliance:** The rule is ambitious but ignored due to lack of state will, capacity, or societal resistance.
    *   **Instability:** The rules are frequently replaced ("serial replacement") to match the short-term preferences of those in power.
*   **Relational Enforcement:** Compliance is not just state capacity; it is a negotiation between state enforcement from above and societal "coproduction" from below.

### 7. Bates: "The New Institutionalism" (The Legacy of Douglass North)
Bates reviews the evolution of the field, highlighting the transition from "market fundamentalism" to "good governance".

*   **Institutions as Capital:** He proposes viewing institutions as a form of **capital**—an investment in political effort to increase the likelihood of future value.
*   **The Productive Use of Coercion:** Bates emphasizes a deep insight from game theory: **coercion can be socially productive** if it creates credible threats that allow welfare-enhancing bargains (like property rights) to form.
*   **The Role of Politics:** Using examples from Africa (Kenya vs. Uganda), he argues that institutions are not autonomous; they are **Janus-faced** and will be predatory or productive depending on whether politicians are rewarded for creating wealth or seizing it.

### 8. Pincus & Robinson: "What Really Happened During the Glorious Revolution?"
This paper offers a revisionist view of 1688, arguing that the shift was more political than legal.

*   **De Facto vs. De Jure:** They argue that North and Weingast overemphasize *de jure* (legal) rule changes, noting the 1689 Settlement actually established very few new laws.
*   **The Whig Program:** The Revolution’s significance lay in a **de facto shift in power** to the **Whig party**, which possessed a specific program for economic modernization and manufacturing.
*   **New Locus of Authority:** The real change was that **party-political ministries**, rather than the King’s private advisors, began initiating policy and were forced to be responsive to public pressure.
