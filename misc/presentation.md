#1 Introduction
Today, I will introduce my research proposal. This project aims to answer a classical question that has been widely discussed in the context of American politics, but I move this question beyond the United States to a global, comparative perspective.
I aim to propose a framework that can capture cross-national variation in state–market relations, in order to better understand who governs under different social and political contexts.
More specifically, the question “Who governs?” asks who holds power and who is able to influence policy outcomes.
A core concept in my proposal is mutual embeddedness, which I will introduce later.

#2 U.S.-centered answers
What are the existing answers to the question “Who governs?” in the United States?
Much of the literature focuses on the influence of economic interests on policymaking. Many studies argue that governance in the United States is largely constrained by markets and economic elites.

#3 Moving beyond the United States
Let me now move beyond the United States.
When we look globally, we see large variations in state–market relations, and these patterns may or may not resemble the U.S. case.
For example, in the United Kingdom, …
In China, …
In Singapore, …
These cases suggest that to answer the question “Who governs?” more generally, we need a framework that can systematically capture these cross-national variations in state–market relations.
# 4 Establish a framwork
At this point, I want to explain why existing answers are not sufficient, especially in the U.S. context.
Much of the literature implicitly relies on a binary view of the state versus the market. Either the state governs, or the market governs.
However, this binary view oversimplifies state–market relations. In reality, these relations vary a lot across countries.
In addition, state–market relations are bidirectional. States shape markets, but markets also constrain states. Yet many studies examine this relationship in a unidirectional way, focusing on only one direction of influence.

So this raises a natural question: what kind of framework do we need?
I argue that we need a framework that is non-binary, meaning it can capture more fine-grained differences across countries.
We also need a framework that is bidirectional, one that takes seriously the influence of both the state and the market.

# 5 Core argument
This leads to my core argument.
To better understand variation in state–market relations, I propose to decompose these relations into two conceptual dimensions.

Relative power
The first dimension is relative power.
This refers to how powerful the state is relative to the market, or vice versa.
In simple terms, this dimension captures whether the state has the capacity to override or veto market actors, or whether markets are able to constrain or discipline the state.
You can think of this dimension as the relative size of the state and the market as actors, as illustrated in the figure on the left.

Mutual embeddedness
The second dimension is mutual embeddedness.
This refers to the extent to which political and economic elites overlap and operate within shared networks and institutions.
In some countries, political elites and business elites are deeply connected through career paths, organizations, and personal networks. In other cases, the two fields remain relatively separate.
This dimension captures the position of the state and the market vis-à-vis each other, rather than their relative strength, as shown in the figure on the right.

Taken together, these two dimensions allow us to move beyond a simple state-versus-market view and to systematically compare different patterns of state–market relations across countries.
#6 Taxonomy
Now let me show how these two dimensions combine to generate a simple taxonomy of state–market relations.
On this slide, the vertical axis represents the state’s relative power, while the horizontal axis represents the level of mutual embeddedness between political and economic elites.
Combining these two dimensions gives us four ideal-typical regimes.
In the bottom-left quadrant, we have weak states, where the state has limited power relative to the market and where mutual embeddedness is low. In these cases, such as Myanmar, the state lacks the capacity to govern effectively.
In the bottom-right quadrant, we see market-dominated states, such as the United States and the United Kingdom. Here, the state’s relative power is low, but embeddedness is high, meaning that markets and economic elites play a major role in shaping policy outcomes.
Moving to the top-left quadrant, we find dirigiste states, such as China and Russia. In these cases, the state possesses strong power over markets, but mutual embeddedness remains limited.
Finally, in the top-right quadrant are developmental states, such as South Korea, where strong state power coexists with high levels of embeddedness between political and economic elites.
This taxonomy allows us to organize very different national cases within a single comparative framework.

#7 Concept ExplanationLet me now explain these two dimensions in more detail.
Moderator
Importantly, I do not treat mutual embeddedness as simply another outcome. Instead, I conceptualize it as a moderating factor.
In this simple expression, state power affects outcomes such as state capture, but the magnitude and direction of that effect depend on the level of embeddedness.
This highlights that state power alone is not sufficient to explain governance outcomes; how the state and the market are connected also matters.

#8 Who Governs Across Regimes?
Based on this framework, we can now return to the original question: who governs?
The answer depends on the regime type.
In dirigiste states, governance is clearly dominated by the state.
In developmental states, governance takes the form of co-governance between state and market elites.
In market-dominated states, markets are able to veto or override state policies.
Finally, in weak states, the state fails to govern at all, and authority becomes fragmented rather than centralized.
This comparison highlights that the question of “who governs” does not have a single answer. Instead, it varies systematically across different configurations of state power and mutual embeddedness.
