### 1. The Institutionalist View: Colonial Origins of Development
**Authors:** Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson (2001)

*   **Argument:** Modern differences in income per capita are largely driven by the **persistence of colonial institutions**.
*   **Reasoning:** Colonization strategies were determined by the **feasibility of European settlement**. In high-mortality environments, Europeans established "extractive states" to transfer resources to the metropole. In low-mortality environments, they established "Neo-Europes" with strong property rights and checks on government power. These early institutions persisted long after independence because the costs of building new institutions are high, and the elites often benefit from extractive structures.
*   **Evidence:** The authors use **European settler mortality rates** from the 17th–19th centuries as an "instrument" for current institutions. Their data show a strong negative relationship: countries with high historical settler mortality have worse property rights today and are significantly poorer.

### 2. The Human Capital Critique: Education as the Driver
**Authors:** Glaeser, La Porta, et al. (2004)

*   **Argument:** **Human capital (education)** is a more fundamental cause of growth than political institutions. 
*   **Reasoning:** "Good" institutions are often a *consequence* rather than a *cause* of economic prosperity. Educated citizens are more likely to demand and sustain democratic institutions. Furthermore, many "miracle" economies (like South Korea and Taiwan) grew rapidly under dictators who provided secure property rights despite the lack of constitutional constraints on their power.
*   **Evidence:** The authors demonstrate that **initial levels of schooling** are a more powerful predictor of future growth than initial levels of institutional quality. They also find that institutional measures (like "protection against expropriation") are highly volatile and tend to improve *after* wealth is created.

### 3. The Plan-Rational State: The Japanese "Miracle"
**Author:** Chalmers Johnson (1982)

*   **Argument:** Japan’s rapid growth was the result of a **"plan-rational" developmental state** rather than a "regulatory" market state.
*   **Reasoning:** In a developmental state, the government gives greatest precedence to **industrial policy**—the concern with which industries ought to exist and which are no longer needed. A "pilot agency" (like **MITI**) orchestrates this by using "administrative guidance" to nurture strategic industries and coordinate competition.
*   **Evidence:** Johnson provides an institutional history of MITI (1925–1975), showing how it shifted Japan’s industrial structure from textiles to heavy and chemical industries. He argues this was achieved through control over foreign exchange, capital, and the authority to create cartels.

### 4. The Theory of Backwardness: Catching Up via Institutions
**Author:** Alexander Gerschenkron (1962)

*   **Argument:** Industrialization in "backward" countries differs fundamentally from the experience of advanced ones; the more backward a country is, the more it requires **institutional substitutes** to spark growth.
*   **Reasoning:** Backward countries have a "backlog" of foreign technology they can borrow, which allows for a "spurt" of rapid growth. However, because they must launch many industries simultaneously to succeed (the "big push"), they face massive capital and coordination requirements.
*   **Evidence:** Gerschenkron compares European cases: **England** grew gradually via private wealth; **Germany** (more backward) required large **investment banks** to coordinate capital; **Russia** (extremely backward) required the **state** to use taxation to force investment into heavy industry.

### 5. The Political Economy of Policy: Rents and Urban Bias
**Author:** Robert Bates (1981)

*   **Argument:** Agricultural policies in Tropical Africa are often economically irrational but **politically logical** for regime survival.
*   **Reasoning:** African governments need to appease the **urban sector** (workers and industry) who demand low food prices to prevent unrest. To do this, they use monopsonistic **marketing boards** to pay farmers below-market prices, effectively taxing the rural sector to subsidize the city and state-led industrialization.
*   **Evidence:** Case studies from Nigeria, Ghana, and Kenya show that governments preferred **subsidizing inputs** (like fertilizer) for a few elite farmers over raising prices for all farmers. This allowed them to create **"rents"**—privileged access to scarce resources—which they used to build a loyal political following.

### 6. The Coevolutionary Approach: Reconciling State and Market
**Author:** Yuen Yuen Ang (2017)

*   **Argument:** States and markets **coevolve**; the type of state capacity needed changes as development progresses.
*   **Reasoning:** You do not necessarily need "perfect" Weberian bureaucracies to *start* growth. Instead, "weak" institutions (like personal connections and patronage) can be adapted to spark emerging markets when formal rules are missing. As markets mature, they then stimulate the creation of "strong" Weberian institutions to preserve those markets.
*   **Evidence:** Ang uses longitudinal case studies of **Chinese locales**, showing how a city (Forest Hill) first used an unspecialized "beehive campaign" (all officials courting investors via personal ties) to build a market, only adopting specialized, professional agencies once growth had reached a "launching stage".

### 7. Synthesis: The Democratic Developmental State
**Author:** Stephan Haggard (2018)

*   **Argument:** The developmental state model is a heterodox approach that emphasizes **state capacity**, solving **coordination problems**, and the **"discipline" of the private sector**.
*   **Reasoning:** Rapid growth requires a state that is both "autonomous" (to resist rent-seeking) and "embedded" (linked to the private sector to share information). Success depends on the state’s ability to make subsidies conditional on performance.
*   **Evidence:** Haggard reviews the East Asian "miracles," noting that while they were often authoritarian, their success was rooted in **cross-class coalitions** and **productivist welfare regimes** that prioritized education. He discusses the move toward "democratic developmental states," where growth is fueled by human capability expansion rather than just capital accumulation.
