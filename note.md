State: Definition, Capacity and Autonomy

Weber: Bureaucracy
Pre-reflection:
Bureaucracy is an ideal type, which can be derived directly from the concept - rationalization. Bureaucracy is a rational construction that helps to fulfill certain goals. To get organizational goals accomplished, different functional units should be established. They should follow certain rules for operations and inter-unit communications.

Reading notes:
Question: there is a famous distinction between politicians and civil servants, politics and administrations.
1 Limited scope of power - finite set
	1. Bureaucratic authority  (power + legitimacy) - public and lawful government.
	2. Bureaucratic management - private economics domination. 
	3. Therefore, bureaucracy is a set of methods for achieving certain goals and running an organization.
	4. Weber claims that bureaucracy is developed in the modern era - in both economic entities and states. However, this claim is by no means true, that in ancient China, there were already bureaucracy. This is related to the understanding of modernity and rationalization.
2 ranked authority or power - ordered field
3 written documents

The public domain should be separated from the private domain - this really involves the very origin of the power. Because bureaucracy is an assistant of the authority holder. Therefore, it is vital to recognize clear what the original authority is. 

4 Competent employees and specialized skills
5 full working capacity of the official.
6 the management follows general rules.

7 impersonal

8 enjoying distinct social esteem
  why does persons holding such social positions enjoy distinct, or high social esteem: 
  1. a strong demand for administration by trained experts.
  2. a strong and stable social differentiation
  3. it is costly to replace him and it is the convention to respect him

9 the position of the official is held for life
  this links to a question: what is the function of the state in Weber's opinion. It means that officials' work is independent of personal considerations, assuming they work accordingly.

10 the officials are paid

11 the official is set for a career

Because the organization or the authority wants to avoid certain circumstances if these measures are not implemented that in the private economy, there is a career, people with more experience tend to earn higher. To avoid the other sectors being exploited by the officials who hold power, some aspects of the bureaucracy should resemble the general status.

The Manifesto of the Communists
Marx sees the human history as the history of class struggle. State is the machinery for class ruling.
Marx is also describing an ideal type, which has obviously simplified the world greatly. He claims there will be unresolvable conflicts between the bugeoisses and the protrains.

Beyond the Democracy Debate
	1. Perhaps the core idea of putting this chapter in this week's reading is that it involves another dimension of the state: democracy v.s. authoritarian.
	2. The question is why political scientists would see democracy is universally superior than other types of regimes, i.e. authoritarian and autocracy.
	3. "in the new western consensus, democracy was portrayed as the inevitable and superior endpoint of human political history."
	4. What is the growing threat to all states regardless of regime type.
	5. The chapter wants to explain the deconstruction of the modern administration.
	6. Another dimension to be added to the taxonomy: personalism v.s. proceduralism.

Bring State Back In
The state must be considered as more than the government. It is the continuous administrative, legal, bureaucratic and coercive systems that attempt not only to structure relationships between civil society and public authority in a polity but also to structure many crucial relationships within civil society as well.
	1. States are not passive
	2. States are actors
	3. Treat states as causal variables - looking as the effect of stateâ€™s behavior, structure and so on
	4. This is somewhat a revival of Weberian approach and an extension:
		a. Weber treated the state as a distinctive organization and emphasizes the state structures and capacity.
		b. Extend comparative analysis, and autonomy.

State Autonomy
	1. Begin by the definition of state:
		a. A differentiated set of institutions and personnel, embodying
		b. Centrality, in the sense that political relations radiate outwards from a centre to cover a
		c. Territorially decentralized  area, over which it exercises
		d. A monopoly of authoritative binding rule-making, backed up by a monopoly of the means of physical violence.
	2. Two meanings of the state:
		a. Despotic power of the state elite - Chinese emperor, Roman emperor, Soviet elites
		b. Infrastructural power: state capacity - China's system and capacity of governace
	3. Why controls these states? 
		a. The capitalist democracies is less likely to be an autonomous state elite, because there are many structural and legal constraints. So, in one sense, states in the capitalist democracies are weak.
		b. Democracies are despotically weak but infrastructually strong.
	4. Question: why such wide divergencies on one dimension - democracy v.s. despotism, but a developmental trend on the other - infrastructural power?
	5. The state power itself does not derive from techniques or means of power that are peculiar to itself. Three main types of power: military, economic and ideological.
	6. Origin of State Power
		a. The necessity of the state: society with state is superior that stateless ones.
		b. The multiplicity of state functions - domestic stability, sovereignty and territory integrity and economic and social development.
		c. Territory centralized
	7. Although we may think that state is the instrument of class ruling, this is too simplified. State has its own autonomy. 

Political Order
	1. The most important political distinction among countries concerns not their form of government but their degree of government.  - Governance.
	2. The primary thesis of this book is that it was in large part the product of rapid social change and the rapid mobilization of new groups into politics compiled with the slow development of political institutions.
	3. The source of instability in some parts of the world: equality of political participation is growing much more rapidly than the art of associating together.
	4. The two goals are quite independent: economic development and political stability
	5. The core argument: rapid social and economic change, without corresponding political institutionalization, produces instability, disorder and, decay.
	6. Corruption correlates reasonably well with rapid social and economic modernization.
	7. Why does modernization breed corruption? 1. Anomie - corruption requires some recognition of the difference between public role and private interest; 2. modernization creates a new source of wealth and power. 3. Modernization involves the expansion of governmental authority and the multiplication of the activities subjected to governmental regulation.
	8. When the infrastructural power is strong, the corruption may be server if that is weak, such as China is stronger than Japan.
	9. Corruption is a product of modernization and particularly of the expansion of political consciousness and political participation.
	10. Corruption thrives on disorganization, the absence of stable relationships among groups and of recognized patterns of authority.
	11. 

Cities, People and language.
	1. Question: how do states transform this complexity into something legible and administratively manageable?
	2. Map - military mapping.
	3. Three approaches of this geometric order in human settlement bear emphasis:
		a. From above and from outside.
		b. A second point is that the grand plan of the ensemble has no necessary relationship to the order of life as it is experienced by its residents.
		c. The third notable aspect of homogenous geometrical uniform property is its convenience as a standardized commodity for the market.
	4. The creation of surnames
	- Naming system - which is not valid in China, but somehow we have a registration system
	5. The directive for a standard, official language
	6. The centralization of traffic patterns
