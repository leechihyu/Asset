Andres Uribe — Criminal Governance in Latin America: Prevalence and Correlates

	1. In Latin America, state and criminal governance often overlap, forming an antagonistic but ultimately stable “duopoly of violence.”
	2. The paper conceptualizes and measures criminal governance (CG).
	3. It argues that respondents report their experiences with respect to their neighborhoods rather than their entire cities.
	4. The study finds an interesting result: there is a positive association between state presence and criminal governance.
	5. Two main takeaways:
a) The sheer extent of criminal governance across Latin America.
b) Its concentration in areas where state institutions are relatively strong.
	6. Definition: Criminal governance refers to the imposition of rules or restrictions on behavior by a criminal organization.
	7. Summary:
In many Latin American communities, criminal organizations provide basic order and security. While multidisciplinary research has illuminated the dynamics of criminal governance (CG) through numerous site-specific studies, its overall extent remains understudied. Using novel, nationally representative survey data—validated against qualitative sources—the authors estimate CG prevalence in 18 countries and explore its correlates at multiple levels.
Overall, 14% of respondents report that local criminal groups provide order and/or reduce crime, corresponding to 77–101 million Latin Americans experiencing some form of criminal governance. Counterintuitively, CG is positively correlated with both respondents’ perceptions of state governance quality and objective measures of local state presence. These findings are consistent with multiple causal pathways, including evidence that state presence—rather than absence—can foster criminal governance.
The authors conclude with suggestions for improving data collection on CG and emphasize the importance of incorporating it into broader research on economic development, demography, and politics.

Daron Acemoglu — The Colonial Origins of Comparative Development: An Empirical Investigation

	1. The authors exploit differences in European mortality rates across colonies to estimate the effect of institutions on economic performance. Europeans adopted very different colonization policies, which led to distinct institutional structures.
		○ In colonies where Europeans faced high mortality rates, they could not settle and instead established extractive institutions.
		○ In contrast, in places where Europeans could settle, such as the United States, Australia, and New Zealand, they created institutions that enforced the rule of law and encouraged investment.
These early institutional differences have persisted to the present. Exploiting variation in European mortality rates as an instrument for modern institutions, the authors find large effects of institutional quality on income per capita. Once institutional effects are controlled for, countries in Africa or near the equator no longer show systematically lower incomes.
	2. Many economists and social scientists argue that institutional and policy differences are at the root of the large income disparities across countries. However, identifying the determinants of institutions and their causal effects on development has been difficult. This paper proposes that colonial experiences provide an exogenous source of variation in institutions.
The argument rests on three premises:
(1) Europeans adopted distinct colonization strategies.
- Settler colonies (e.g., the U.S., Australia, New Zealand) established institutions protecting property rights and promoting investment.
- Extractive colonies (e.g., the Congo, the Gold Coast) created states designed to transfer resources to the metropole, hindering long-term development.
(2) The choice of colonization strategy depended partly on European mortality rates: where mortality was high, Europeans could not settle and thus established extractive institutions.
(3) These early institutions persisted and shaped modern governance.
The authors find strong correlations among:
		○ Mortality rates faced by soldiers, bishops, and sailors in the colonies.
		○ The likelihood of European settlement.
		○ Early institutional structures and modern institutional quality.
Using mortality rates as an instrument, they estimate large causal effects of institutions on income per capita. The results are robust to controls for latitude, climate, current disease environment, religion, natural resources, soil quality, ethnolinguistic fragmentation, and racial composition.
Overall, the paper provides compelling evidence that historical institutional differences—rooted in colonial conditions—are a major determinant of modern economic inequality across nations.

Sebastián Mazzuca - Latecomer State Formation: Political Geography and Capacity Failure in Latin America

State Formation versus State Building: Latin America and Western Europe Compared
	1. If state formation is understood strictly as the monopolization of violence within the borders of a territory, it can be distinguished from state building—that is, the creation of central capacities to tax the population and to provide public goods efficiently and evenly throughout the territory.
	2. Processes of state formation can be divided into two broad modal paths: war-led and trade-led.
	3. The war-led path results in strong states, where state formation is coupled with state building. In contrast, the trade-led path produces weak states, where state formation is decoupled from state building and may even become an obstacle to it.
	4. The theoretical deficit in the literature has two main sources:
		○ First, theories of state formation are largely based on the truncated sample of the pioneering Western European experience.
		○ Second, much of the literature reduces state formation to the monopolization of violence, overlooking that state formation also involves territorial consolidation.


Nathan Noah - the origins of inequality

This chapter explains how two early interventions by the modern state—the invention of chieftaincy and the introduction of education—jointly produced enduring patterns of inequality within Northern Ghanaian communities. By selectively recognizing certain families as chiefs and granting them privileged access to education, the colonial and early postcolonial state created new intra-ethnic and intra-village economic hierarchies that persist today.
Mechanism: From Chieftaincy to Education Advantage
Families elevated to chieftaincy positions benefited not through rent extraction but through privileged access to a scarce state. Chiefs’ families were the first to enroll their children in schools, creating “school pioneers” who gained early entry into the formal economy. Their subsequent economic success allowed them to reinvest in the education of relatives, concentrating advantage within certain lineages and giving rise to a new Northern elite. This process generated persistent intergenerational inequality within ethnic groups.
In contrast, “never recognized” communities—those where the state did not impose chieftaincy—lacked such intermediaries. Schools were established much later, when the economic returns to education had already declined, and early enrollment was more evenly distributed across families. As a result, these communities display lower intra-ethnic inequality today.
Empirical Strategy
The chapter leverages the exogenous colonial assignment of chieftaincy based on the pre-1914 Anglo-German border to identify causal effects. While some acephalous groups (e.g., the Frafra and Dagaba) were given chiefs, others (e.g., the Konkomba) were not. Comparing these “invented chiefs” and “never recognized” communities, the author finds that:
	• Intra-communal and intra-ethnic inequality is significantly higher among “invented chiefs” communities.
	• The primary mechanism is early, concentrated access to education among chiefs’ families.
The analysis rules out alternative explanations, such as pre-existing social stratification or geographic differences, and uses the “always chiefs” groups descriptively but excludes them from the main identification strategy due to their endogenous precolonial hierarchies.
Implications
The findings highlight how the state’s early, selective interventions—meant to impose order and modernize society—had unintended consequences for long-term inequality. By creating privileged intermediaries and unequal access to education, the colonial state entrenched durable socio-economic hierarchies within communities that were otherwise similar prior to colonization.
