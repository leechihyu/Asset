Charles Tilly  - War Making and State Making as organized Crime

	1. This paper provides an alternative to the state-making story: state making qualifies as the largest examples of organized crimes.
	2. Other theories are: social contract; open market; shared norms within a society.
	3. This thinking originates from worries about the increasing destructiveness of war, the expanding role of great powers as suppliers of arms and military organization to poor countries, and the growing importance of military tile in those same countries.
	4. Tilly's national states: relatively centralized, differentiated organizations, the officials of which more or less successfully claim control over the chief concentrated means of violence within  population inhabiting a large, contiguous territory.
	5. Someone needs to provide protection. At the same time, this guy can also be the source of danger. A legitimate protector is a universal protector.
	6. Someone who creates a threat and then charges for its reduction. By this standard, governments' provision of protection often qualifies as racketeering.
	7. KEY QUESTION: How do racket governments themselves acquire AUTHORITY?
	8. There is a tendency for an organization to monopolize its power.
	9. War making, extraction, and capital accumulation interacted to shape European state making.
	10. During wartime, or at the early stage of state-making, "legitimate" organizations and "illegitimate organizations" interwined.
	11. Protection as Business. Monopoly in providing protection is the most efficient, according to Lane.
	12. Lane's four successive stages in the general history of capitalism: 1. anarchy and plunder; tribute takers tried to monopolize; merchants and landlords gain more from protection rents than governors from tribute; technological changes surpassed protection rent as sources of profit for entrepreneurs.
	13. According to Bean, military innovation promoted the creation of large, expensive, well-armed national states.
	14. What Do States Do? The agents of states characteristically carry on four different activities: 1. war making; 2. state making; 3. protection; 4. extraction.
	15. How States Formed? Popular resistance to war making and state making made a difference. The relative balance among war making, protection, extraction, and state making significantly affected the organization of the states that emerged from the four activities.

Didac Queralt - War, International Finance, and Fiscal Capacity in the Long Run
	1. Tax-financed war faciliates the adoption of power-sharing institutions, which transform taxation into a non-zero-sum game, carrying on the effect of war in the long run.
	2. Financing war with external capital does not contribute to long-term fiscal capacity if borrowers interrupt debt service and war debt in condoned or exchanged for nontax revenue.
	3. Globalization of capital markets in the nineteenth century undermined the association between war, state making, and political reform.
	4. War clears the path to fiscal centralization, the professionalization of the tax administration, and the adoption of new taxes. Fiscal innovations are often accompanied by complementary organizations, including treasuries and central banks, and improved budgeting technologies.
	5.  simple decision-theoretic model suggests that the ruler’s preference for foreign loans relative to taxes depends on a combination of domestic and international conditions. First, shorter time horizons strengthen the ruler’s preference for external finance because gains in fiscal capacity are realized only in the long run. Shorter time horizons are consistent with political instability and scenarios in which political survival depends on winning war, hence the ability to mobilize resources in a timely manner. Second, low levels of initial state capacity make external finance more appealing because the latter secures funds that exceed the short-run possibilities of taxation. Third, low levels of initial power-sharing institutions strengthen preference for external finance because the alternative—taxation—involves higher political concessions. Fourth, cycles of high liquidity in the international credit market favor external finance. High liquidity implies more favorable loan terms even for countries with dubious fundamentals, thus increasing the present value of external finance. Fifth, an extended practice of external debt relief and the exchange of old bonds for nontax revenue and state monopolies limit the future cost of default, strengthening the preference for external loans over taxes. 
	6. What kinds of war are under discussion here? Domestic war or international war? 114 interstate wars and 33 secessionist wars.
	7. The author compares the relative effect of war waged when countries have and lack access to the international capital markets for exogenous reasons.
	8. Shock: banking crises in global financial centers.

Hendrik Spruyt - Institutional Selection in International Relations: State Anarchy as Order
	1. Question: why by the middle of the seventeenth century, city-states and city-leagues had fallen by the wayside? How sovereign territorial states displaced their contemporary rivals.
	2. The sovereign territorial state prevailed because it proved more effective at preventing defection by its members, reducing internal transaction costs, and making credible commitments to other units. 1) sovereign rulers were better at centralizing jurisdiction and authority. 2) sovereign territoriality, when confirmed to other actors, was a means of structuring interunit behavior. 3) as a consequence of the first two conditions, actors from other institutional arrangements defected to states or copied their institutional makeup.
	3. The focus of this essay is on a critical feature of the modern state: the principle of. Sovereignty - the principle that authority is limited by precise spatial terms and is subject to no other authority.
	4. Question: when do individuals who engage in economic transactions seek hierarchy? Departing from a perspective of embryology, this section aims to explain the formation of states.
	5. Coase theorem; the consequences of institutional choice - the ability to prevent free riding and the ability to credibly commit. 
	6. This article will take a perspective of a microlevel focus on the contractual nature of institutions. 
	7. Two keep components: avoiding free-riding and defection, commit credibly.
	8. Two historical solutions to markets and hierarchy.
	9. To summarize, hierarchy is efficient.
	10. The city-league had problems with establishing internal hierarchy and consequently it was less successful than states in standardizing coinage and centralizing Jurisdiction. Externally, it was not able to credibly commit to international treaties. Moreover, given its lack of clearly defined territorial jurisdiction, it was less compatible with the territorial units in the international system.
	11. Some actors prefer those institutions that can reduce the uncertainty in their internal and external environment. Sovereign authorities also reduced the problems facing transboundary trade by providing for clear focal points through which to negotiate.
	12. Answers: 1. It’s more efficient; 2. Natural selection; 3. This type can reduce transaction costs. Here transactions costs refer to the cost of concluding any forms of contract in a given economy. 4. Transaction costs are related to if the state has incentive to reduce it.

Scott Abramson - The Economic Origins of the Territorial State
	1. This paper challenges the long-standing belief that changes in patterns of wars and war-making caused the emergence of large territorial states.
	2. This paper found that small political units continued to thrive well into the age of the territorial state.
	3. In the theories of Tilly’s tradition, war made states through a Darwinian process - large states were more capable than their smaller counterparts of meeting the demands of war, and were more likely to survive.
	4. The paper provides evidence for the set of economic theories, that views the development of the territorial state in some places as the consequence of variation in the dominant social coalitions that formed from changing patterns of trade and economic development.
	5. What are states: states are the organizations that maintain a quasi-monopoly of violence over a fixed territory.
	6. Operationalization: direct military occupation; the capacity to tax; a common executive.
	7. The paper tested the causal relationship between urban development on the state formation.
	8. Why this instrumental variable? 1) cereals were maple; 2) the ability to grow cereals has been directly linked to the support of large populations.
	9. Instrumental variable: anomaly temperature.

Agustina Paglayan - Education or Indoctrination? The Violent Origins of Public School Systems in an Era of State-Building

	1. This article developed a theory of mass education as a state-building tool that is deployed in response to internal conflicts, and offers evidence for it from the development of public primary education systems in Europe and Latin America.
	2. The author argues that influenced by the frightening experience of internal conflict involving mass violence against the state, national elites expanded public primary schooling to indoctrinate future citizens to accept the status quo, hoping that this would help the state carry out its most essential function: to prevent social disorder and ensure political stability.
	3. Interestingly, the author focuses on the role of education in “state-building” rather than “nation-building”.
	4. The core problem now becomes how to gain or foster authority and legitimacy through mass education.
	5. Empirical findings: the primary school enrollment rates accelerate following civil wars.
	6. Fact from China: In 1938, there were 217,000 primary schools, increasing to over 290,000 by 1946, and the number of primary school students grew from 122,800 to 238,000. The number of secondary school students also increased, from nearly 390,000 in 1937 to 1.566 million in 1945.In 1938, there were 217,000 primary schools, increasing to over 290,000 by 1946, and the number of primary school students grew from 122,800 to 238,000. The number of secondary school students also increased, from nearly 390,000 in 1937 to 1.566 million in 1945.
	7. Argument: starting in the late eighteenth but especially during the nineteenth century, European and Latin American states began regulating, funding, and expanding primary education for the masses. This effort to create and expand a state-regulated primary education system was an important component of a state-building agenda designed to promote social order… when acute enough to threaten the state’s authority, these episodes made national elites update their assessment of the costs and benefits of proving primary education.

Anna Grzymala-Busse - Beyond War and Contract: The Medieval and Religious Roots of the European State
	1. War may have provided the incentives to build states - but peace and stability provided the capacity to do so.
	2. In medieval state building, would-be states competed in markets for protection and governance.
	3. The domestic balance of power may matter more than international warfare for state formation.
The literature on state building has increasingly made two significant shifts: from war to domestic institutions, and from the early modern to the medieval period as the foundational mome![Uploading image.png…]()
